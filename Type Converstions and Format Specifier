==>Variables:

Variable = values  ==> ( Dynamically Type = It will automatically detect the Data type ) 
			(int,str,float....)
ex:			
a=5
print(type(a)) = int

Rules in declaring variables:

* It starts with Alphabets or _ (underscore)
* Shouldnot contain any space in between the variable ( Ex: emp id , Emp_ID)
* Shouldnot use special character other than underscore ( ex: %,&,*...)
* Shouldnot user with Numerical values in variable

==>Type:

To know the type of datatype

Syntax:

print(type(variable))

Ex: 

Age = 33
print(age)
print(type(age) 

Output: 
33
<class 'int'>

==>Type Conversion:

+ --> Can use only for string
, --> Can use for both string and Int

age = 29
name = "Arvi"
height=5.6

print("My name is",name)
print("My age is",age)

print("My name is",name,"and","My age is",age)

==>Format Specifier:

%s ==> string
%d ==> int
%f ==> float

==> Other way of Format Specifier

print("My name is {} my age is {}".format(name,age))
print("My name is {} my age is {}".format(age,name))

print("My name is {name} and age is {age}")
print(f"My name is {name} and age is {age}")
